🧠 Excited to share CORE-Bench - my new LLM reasoning benchmark on Kaggle!

I created a Comprehensive Ordered Reasoning Evaluation (CORE) benchmark to test how well AI models really think.

📊 THE RESULTS ARE IN:

🥇 Top Performers (96.1% accuracy):
   • Gemini 3 Pro Preview
   • Gemini 3 Flash Preview  
   • DeepSeek V3.2
   • Qwen 3 Next 80B

🥈 Close Behind (94.1% accuracy):
   • Claude Haiku 4.5

🎯 WHAT CORE-BENCH TESTS:

✅ Logical Deduction (15 problems)
   Syllogisms, modus ponens, fallacy detection

✅ Mathematical Reasoning (15 problems)
   Multi-step word problems, percentages, geometry

✅ Causal Reasoning (15 problems)
   Cause-effect, counterfactuals, correlation vs causation

✅ Analogical Reasoning (6 problems)
   Pattern completion (A:B :: C:?)

🔍 KEY FINDINGS:

1️⃣ Multi-step planning is a differentiator - Claude Haiku 4.5 struggled with the river crossing puzzle

2️⃣ Reasoning quality evaluation reveals gaps - stricter judge-based criteria caught issues in top models

3️⃣ Core reasoning tasks are becoming saturated - all models aced logic, math, causal, and analogy tasks

💡 This suggests we need HARDER problems to truly differentiate next-gen AI capabilities.
